# 2) Getting Started
To run the code in C, first we need to get the environment.

## NOTE:

- If you are using Linux, just open a terminal and run the following commands. 
- If you using Windows, get the Linux Terminal from Microsoft Store (search up on Google if you don't know how to get around this).

## Follow the steps to get started:

#### i) Git clone the repository:

#### ii) Install the C compiler:

```shell
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install build-essential
```

#### iii) Now to run the code:

- There are two types of files: TurtleGraphics and TurtleGraphicsSimple.
- TurtleGraphics has colour whereas the TurtleGraphicsSimple does not have colour.

**To Run TurtleGraphics:**

```shell
$ make TurtleGraphics
$ ./TurtleGraphics charizard.txt
$ ./TurtleGraphics diamond.txt
```
**To Run TurtleGraphicsSimple:**

```shell
$ make TurtleGraphicsSimple
$ ./TurtleGraphicsSimple charizard.txt
$ ./TurtleGraphicsSimple diamond.txt
```
